We are a dedicated Team. Over the past few years we have been building a Cloud and Software Engineering department with a main goal of innovation and improvement of legacy systems, with a forward look into the future of technology and essentially  "bringing the future to the present". Given our background in a highly regulated corporate and financial institution we are used to challenges accompanied with high velocity and high expectations in the aspect of time, quality and dedication.  
We possess thorough knowledge in the areas of: Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, VMware, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, Docker and many more.

### What is our mission?
To provide sustainable, scalable and innovative infrastructure and software solutions. In order to achieve this and remain a sustainable business we are focusing on the following areas: Consulting and Software as a Service (SaaS). The latter is in development and will be available as a Minimum Viable Product in the coming months, with a confirmed feature set and implementation roadmap which will be published in August 2020 on our company website. In terms of consulting we are able to offer consultants (singular as well as in groups) on a contractual basis to potential customers as well as training and team building services. In the area of IT & Cloud Strategy, Enterprise Architecture and Operational Excellence we are able to offer more support to our customers through our highly skilled Solution Architects.
